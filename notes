Key terms in AD DS include:
• Schema: The set of user-configured rules that govern objects and attributes in AD DS.
• Global Catalog: The container for all objects in AD DS. For example, a name associated with a user or a computer is stored in the global catalog.
• Query and Index Mechanism: This system allows users to find each other in AD. A good example would be when typing a name in the mail client, and the mail client shows possible matches.
• Replication Service: The replication service makes sure that every DC on the network has the same Global Catalog and Schema.
• Sites: Sites are representations of the network topology, so AD DS knows which objects go together to optimize replication and indexing.
• Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): LDAP is an industry-standard application protocol that allows AD to communicate with other LDAP-enabled directory services across platforms. Example of its use includes creating a centralized management of AD users for validating access to various applications and services.
Services provided in AD DS include:
• Domain Services: The collection of software and processes that store information about the enterprise, including users and computers.
• Certificate Services: Allows the domain controller to serve and authenticate digital certificates, signatures, and public key cryptography.
• Lightweight Directory Services: The foundation that supports LDAP. LDAP is a vendor-agnostic, industry-standard, protocol used to access and maintain directory information services distributed over an Internet Protocol (IP) network. A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store usernames and passwords.
• Directory Federation Services: Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for multiple applications in the same session. SSO allows users to only use one set of credentials to log on to multiple applications.
• Rights Management: The rules and configurations that control information rights and data access policies. The configurations defined using this service will determine which users can access which files, folders, and/or applications.


GPO is a collection of Group Policy settings that define what a system looks like and how it behaves for a defined group of users. Every GPO has two parts: a user configuration and a computer configuration. Computer-related policies specify system behavior, application settings, security settings, assigned applications, and computer startup and shutdown scripts.

Using the Security Onion index, create a data table visualization to show how many occurrences of event ID 5136 are associated with the user name Leonard Blevins.


NOTE: The event.code and user.name fields should be used in the visualization. 

The next step in the investigation needs to dive into the data of the 25 occurrences of event ID 5136. The goal is to determine which accounts, if any, were affected by Leonard Blevins. 


To determine the accounts that experienced modifications, adjust the current visualization. Aggregate based on the field winlog.event_data.ObjectDN.keyword.
